# KTH-Artificial-Intelligence
Set of gamified scenarios where we implement AI algorithms.

**Search**

We implement minmaxalgorith to create an AI play to a fish game.We implement tree search using iterative deepening with alpha-beta pruning in order to estimate the best move for a particular state. We also implement state hashsing and use it for repeated state checking which greatly improves the overall performance, helping us to go more in deep with the search of the best state.

**HMM**

We implement HMM algorithms:
-Forward and back algorithm
-Viterbi algorithm
-Baum-Welch algorithm
And then we applied them to the same gamified scenario of the Search part, to predict the type of a fish.
